Symbolism of Health and Wellness: Green is also commonly associated with health and wellness. Using green can suggest that consuming Wagh Bakri tea is not just about taste but also about promoting well-being.

Fonts : 

Sans-serif fonts are often chosen for their modern and clean appearance. In the case of Wagh Bakri, this choice could reflect the company's commitment to quality and modernity.

Enhanced Readability: Sans-serif fonts are generally easier to read on digital screens, especially at smaller sizes. This enhances the user experience on the website, making it more accessible and engaging.
